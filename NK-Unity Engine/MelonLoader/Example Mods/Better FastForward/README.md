### This mod was not made with NKHook6
NKHook6 is an api we developed to make modding BTD6/BTDAT as easy as possible. This mod was not made using this api in order to demonstrate how to make mods without it. If you want to see how we made this mod with less code, using NKHook6, OR you want to play this with a configurable fast forward speed, check out the Better FastForward example mod in the [NKHook6 folder](https://github.com/TDToolbox/BTD-Docs/blob/master/NK-Unity%20Engine/Btd6/NKHook6/Example%20Mods/Better%20FastForward/README.md)
