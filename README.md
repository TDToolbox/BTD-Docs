# BTD Documentation
This repository is for documenting anything related to NK modding

- NK Unity - The set of Libs NK uses for BTD6/TK/BATTD
- Solidarity - The name for the BTD5/BTDB/BMC/SAS4 engine/shared code. I'm not entirely sure where the name came from, but unless somebody can verify an actual name for the engine, the wiki will be sticking with it.
