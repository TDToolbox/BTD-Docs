# BTD Documentation
This repository is for documenting anything related to NK modding

Solidarity - The name for the BTD5/BTDB/BMC/SAS4 engine/shared code. I'm not entirely sure where the name came from, but unless somebody can verify an actual name for the engine, the wiki will be sticking with it.  
NK Unity - The set of Libs NK uses for BTD6/TK/BATTD
