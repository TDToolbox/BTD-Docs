# Jet files
Jet files are a way for Solidarity to store properties of game objects. It is simply an encrypted zip file with a collection of Json files.

## Common passwords
The Jet files in most games using the Solidarity codebase use the password `Q%_{6#Px]]` while some (namely Bloons Tower Defense Battles) uses a new one with each update. This password can be used to unpack Jet files using a common archive tool such as 7zip.
