# Plugin Creation
this section will teach you how to create plugins for NKHook5 as well as how to use the SDK and Events documentation. This may sound complicated, but I assure you, I've done everything I can to make it very simple. Check out the [NKH Blue](https://github.com/DisabledMallis/NKHook5/blob/master/NKHook5/NKHook5/NKH/Blue/NKH_Blue.md) documentation for information on getting started with very basic plugin creation.
